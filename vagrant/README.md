# Vagrant development environment

Vagrant starts VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a software computer that runs an operating system.
Here we run Ubuntu 18.04 + the web server Apache 2 + the database MySQL + the language PHP 7.2

When you have installed VirtualBox + Vagrant and run vagrant up then you can surf to
```
http://vagrant.infohub.local/phpinfo.php
and
http://vagrant.infohub.local
```

Read how you do all that in [installation vagrant](installation_vagrant.md).
