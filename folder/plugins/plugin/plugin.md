How to make plugins, read here: [Make plugins](main,plugin)

# What plugins to use
If you want to use a plugin in your system then you must review it first so you are sure there are no strange behaviours.  

Do not use the plugin code if:
- the code is encrypted/obscured so you can not read all code.
- it uses another programming languages than the rest of the core.
- it has named variables or functions so they do not exactly reflect their contents and purpose.
- the code have a lot of comments - that means the code is poorly written.
- the flow in the functions is hard to understand - that means the code is poorly written.
- the documentation is missing or just too long (many words and little facts), or if any existing cmd() function are missing details in the documentation. - If the documentation is bad then probably the plugin is too.
- the test file is missing. - How can you know if the plugin has ever been tested if the test file is missing.
