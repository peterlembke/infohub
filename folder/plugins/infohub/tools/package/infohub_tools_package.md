# Infohub Tools Package

These tools are for developers to examine the traffic to the server.

Paste a messages_encoded here to decode and show the JSON in a pretty format.

# Introduction

In previous Infohub version the package contained an array messages. You could see the JSON code and paste it in PHP
Storm and have it automatically reformatted, so it could be read.

Now the messages are in the messages_encoded, and they are json encoded and base64 encoded.

With this tool you can paste that data and press a button to see the json pretty.
