# Infohub Tools Random
Here you can generate random numbers  

# Introduction
With this tool you can generate random numbers. The work is done by [Infohub Random](plugin,infohub_random).  
Go to the link and read more about different random numbers.  
This graphical user interface (GUI) show a node list, text boxes where you write the minimum number and the maximum number, a button you can press, a text box where you see the result, and a button to clear the box.  

# Nodes
The plugin infohub_uuid that does all the work, it comes in a version for the server node and one version for the client node.
Some of the methods are the same so you can verify your result between the nodes.
Some methods only exist in one of the nodes due to practical reasons.  
If you select the server node and press the button quickly to get many random numbers, then after 1 seconds you will get a lot of numbers at the same time. This is due to the way Infohub communicate with the server.
