# Infohub Tools Checksum
Here you can generate checksums  

# Introduction
With this tool you can generate checksums from [Infohub Checksum](plugin,infohub_checksum).  
There are different kinds of checksums. Check the link above to read more about them.  
This graphical user interface (GUI) show a text box where you enter the data, a list with nodes (client / server), a dropdown where you select the checksum method, and a submit button.  
The checksum will display under that.  

# Nodes
The plugin infohub_checksum that does all the work, it comes in a version for the server node and one version for the client node.
Some of the checksum methods are teh same so you can verify your checksum between the nodes.
Some checksum methods only exist in one of the nodes due to practical reasons.  
The server node are written in PHP. PHP have many more checksums built in. The client node are written in Javascript, here are nothing built in and all checksum functions have to be written.
