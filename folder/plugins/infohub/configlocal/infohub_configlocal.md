# Introduction

Your local browser specific settings are handled with Infohub Config Local - this plugin.  
Here you can set zoom level, select a font, colour schema, preferred languages. You can also set what you allow or not.

# The main menu

When you start Config Local you will first see a main menu. Here you have some options to select from. Each option will
open its settings on the right side.

# Store config

The configuration are stored locally on this device. You can also store the config on the server.

# Zoom

Normally when you have a keyboard you can change the zoom level with CTRL and + or -. (CMD + or - on Mac). If you have a
mouse then you can configure buttons to change the zoom level.  
If you have a mobile phone you can do the pinch with your fingers to zoom in and out. But this zoom is like a magnifier,
it makes you come closer, so you have to side scroll to read the text.  
The Zoom buttons on the other hand increase the objects on the page and keep the page width. The text now require more rows, and you do not have to side scroll.  
The zoom buttons work on desktop too. If the normal CTRL + do not give you enough zoom then you can also use the zoom
buttons to get even more zoom.

# Font

You have different fonts (how symbols are shaped) on different devices. If a font is missing then the device will pick a
similar font from the ones it has.  
With this setting you can see available fonts and select one font. The number of fonts you see will be deliberately few.
Readability is the prime goal.

# Colour

Different eyes need different colours. There is a little set of colours used in infohub. Here you can select your own
colours in that set and store it with a name. You can select the set you want to use and see the result.
