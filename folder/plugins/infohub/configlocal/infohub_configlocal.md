# Introduction
All the plugin configurations are handled with Infohub Config Global. Your local browser specific settings are handled with Infohub Config Local - this plugin.  
Here you can set zoom level, select a font, colour schema, preferred languages. You can also set what you allow or not, like 3rd party streaming services in iframes etc.  

# The main menu
When you start Config Local you will first see a main menu. Here you have some options to select from. Each option will open its settings on the right side.  

# Store config
The configuration are only stored locally on this device for now.
Later versions of Config Local might allow you to set configurations that are the same on all your devices.  

# Zoom
Normally when you have a keyboard you can change the zoom level with CTRL and + or -. (CMD + or - on Mac).
If you have a mouse then you can configure buttons to change the zoom level.  
If you have a mobile phone you can do the pinch with your fingers to zoom in and out. But this zoom is like a magnifier, it makes you come closer so you have to side scroll to read the text.  
The Zoom buttons on the other hand increase the objects on the page and keep the page width. The text now require more rows and you do not have to side scroll.  
The zoom buttons work on desktop too. If the normal CTRL + do not give you enough zoom then you can also use the zoom buttons to get even more zoom.  

# Font
You have different fonts (how symbols are shaped) on different devices. If a font is missing then the device will pick a similar font from the ones it has.  
With this setting you can see available fonts and select one font. The nunber of fonts you see will be deliberately few. Readability is the prime goal.  

# Colour
Different eyes need different colours. There is a little set of colours used in infohub. Here you can select your own colours in that set and store it with a name.
You can select the set you want to use and see the result.  

# Language
Here you can set your preferred language  

# Allow
  
# Autostart
Here you can change what plugins to auto start in the workbench. You will always get launcher. The default is also to get the config local autostarted.
Once you have configured your settings you can select to not autostart config local
