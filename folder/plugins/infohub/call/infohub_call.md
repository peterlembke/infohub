# Introduction
This plugin enables your plugins to call services on the internet. This plugin will be used by the Infohub server to reach other Infohub servers. Also used to get data from Web APIs.
The main thing now is that I want to support the CouchDb database. It has a HTTP interface.

# Other Infohub servers
This is the communication part. There will be more code in this plugin around this in future releases. 

# REST APIs
Support will be implemented later for using REST APIs with JSON.
