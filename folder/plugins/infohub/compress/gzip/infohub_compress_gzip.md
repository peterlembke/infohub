# Infohub Compress Gzip

Compress and decompress data with gzip.

# Gzip compression

I want to use gzip compression on the js client to store data in Storage and localStorage. I also want gzip to be used
in tre traffic between client <> server. And on the server I want gzip to be used when storing data in Storage.

# Gzip library

Gzip is part of Zlib. Zlib is built into PHP. There is also a Zlib implementation in Javascript. This is the one I have
used.
https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js/blob/develop/test/browser/gzip-test.js

Zlib is not built into the browser.

# Implementation in PHP

PHP has a built-in function `gzencode()`, `gzdecode()` that are used in the plugin.

# Implementation in Javascript

Javascript have ZERO commands of any compression algorithms. That could have been in the browser. All implementations
are done in Javascript-code instead.  
The Gzip implementation come
from <a href="https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js/blob/develop/test/browser/gzip-test.js" target="_blank">Imaya Zlib on

The code is then part of plugin infohub_compress_gzip.js

## More information

The Zlib on PHP have different versions of gzip.  
gzcompress(), gzencode(), gzdeflate().

## JS compress JS decompress

This works well. I can compress a UTF-8 string, get a compressed binary base64 back. I can decompress the binary base64
string into a UTF-8 string.

## PHP compress PHP decompress

This works well. I can compress a UTF-8 string, get a compressed binary base64 back. I can decompress the binary base64
string into a UTF-8 string.

This works well. I can compress a UTF-8 string, get a compressed binary base64 back. I can decompress the binary base64
string into a UTF-8 string. The thing here is all conversions needed. See the code.
