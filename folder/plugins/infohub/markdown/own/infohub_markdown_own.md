# Infohub Markdown Own
This is my own Markdown rendering plugin. It has only the basic features.

My aim was to render documentation but I realized that the approach was a bit off for that so I created [infohub_renderdocument](plugin,infohub_renderdocument) instead. You can use that plugin as an alternative to the ones here.
