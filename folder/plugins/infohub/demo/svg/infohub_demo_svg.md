SVG are scalable vector graphics. This demo show some of what the plugin can do.

The demos come from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_feoffset.asp) and have been modified to suite
the Infohub renderer.

## Demos

The two first examples show simple geometric figures. The third demo uses filters. You can reuse the filter on the other
two shapes by adding the same filter parameter to the rectangle and circle.
