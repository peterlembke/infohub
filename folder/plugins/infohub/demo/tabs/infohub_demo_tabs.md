# Infohub Demo Tabs

Shows a demo how you can use the infohub_tabs plugin.

# Introduction

The tab's system are used in Workbench on the top. You click an icon and the right window will show.  
In this demo you can see the exact same tab system in action. This demo uses unicode characters that look different on
different systems. I will remake this demo without unicode characters.
