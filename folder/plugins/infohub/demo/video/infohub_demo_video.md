# InfoHub Demo Video

Shows a demo how you can use the InfoHub render video plugin.

# Introduction

In this demo we show how to use the InfoHub render video plugin.  
You will see all the supported 3rd party services that you can use to display a video player and stream video data from
the internet.  
If you want to host your own video then there is no alternative right now, but there will be.  
Using 3rd party services in the browser is not endorsed because the 3rd party tracks you. Always use the render video
together with a render major.
