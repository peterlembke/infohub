# Introduction
In this demo we show how to use the infohub render form plugin. [Infohub Render Form](plugin,infohub_render_form)  
Render form is a child plugin to Render. The purpose is to create basic form elements. You can use the elements as part of something bigger, as it is done in Infohub_RenderForm.  
In demo form2 you can see how the plugin RenderForm takes the basic elements from Render Form and add functionality to them.
