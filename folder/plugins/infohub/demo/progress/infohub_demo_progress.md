# How the demo works

You see a button and a progress bar with all its text boxes etc.
First click on the button starts the progress bar.
A total of 5 klicks will take you to the finish of the prgress bar.

The "elapsed time" will update automatically.
The "time left" will also update automatically.
The other text boxes and the bar itself will update when you click the button.
THe heart will give one beat when you click the button.

When you reach the five clicks then the demo is over. The bar is at 100%. The elapsed time have stopped counting up.
The time left is at zero.

You can now press the button again to restart the demo.
