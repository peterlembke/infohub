# Presentation box
The button title is: Presentation box.  
You will see three presentation boxes. The first contain just a title and two links. The second contain a title, an image with embedded content that appear when you click the image, and a footer. The third has a title and an image so it is very much like the first one.  

# Usage
The main usage is to box content so you can present it better. You can click the title to fold/unfold the content. Read more about RenderMajor to see the features.  
Look at the videom audio, map demos, they use the presentation box in combination with the iframe.
