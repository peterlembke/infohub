# Infohub Demo Map
Shows a demo how you can use the infohub render map plugin.  

# Introduction
In this demo we show how to use the infohub render map plugin.  
You will see all the supported 3rd party services that you can use to display a map.  
For now these services run directly in your browser. That is not good since you are being tracked. Use Open Street Map (OSM), they are the best when it comes to personal integrity.  
Always use the maps in a rendermajor box and never show them directly. You must give the user a chance to avoid 3rd party services.  
In the future you will be able to get map data from your server instead. But for now that is not possible.
