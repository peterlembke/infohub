# InfoHub Template

Your quick start in InfoHub

[columns]

# Introduction

InfoHub_Template is just a bare-bone plugin to InfoHub that you can copy and rename.  
This gives you a quick start when you create your plugin.

# Different files

The JS file are for JavaScript plugin that you run in the client browser.  
The PHP file are for PHP plugins that you run on the server.  
This XML file are the plugin documentation. Here you write the purpose of the plugin and how it works.  
The JSON files that have a -test- in the name are test data that will be generated by the test system. It is used to
detect change in behavior when you do code changes.  
The JSON file with {plugin_name}.json are the plugin configuration file. Discouraged. It is mainly for things that
absolutely can not be in a Storage.

# The plugin license

If you write your plugin from scratch then you can use any license you want for your plugin. The template license is GNU
GPL v3 or later. If you base your plugin on the template then your plugin will have this license.  
If you want your plugin to work in a standard InfoHub system then it must be licensed as GNU GPL v3. If you modify the
InfoHub core to run other licenses, then you can not call the core InfoHub.

# Build your own plugin

Under the folder "plugins", create your own sub folder for your domain. It can be any low letter name. For this example
we use: mydomain  
Copy the entire folder: "template" from the InfoHub folder to the new "mydomain" folder.  
Set a name for your new plugin by renaming your template-folder. In this example we use: myplugin. This means the files
are renamed to mydomain_myplugin.js, mydomain_myplugin.php, mydomain_myplugin.xml  
Delete the json file. It is not needed and will be auto generated later when we test the new plugin.  
If you only want to create a php plugin then delete the js file.  
Make sure that you have read about the features in [InfoHub_Base](plugin,infohub_base), so you know about the different
function types.  
In `_GetCmdFunctions()` then add all public function names you want to use. Now you can add public functions and
internal functions to your plugin.  
You can now write any code you want in your functions. Just make sure you have set default values just as the template
functions does.
