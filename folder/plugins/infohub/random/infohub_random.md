# InfoHub Random

Functions that give an unpredictable answer

# Introduction

All functions should return a predictable answer. But with things like reading data from external sources, random
numbers, reading the time, then your output will vary even if the input does not.  
In this plugin I focus on random numbers. Use this plugin when you want a random number. The big benefit is that your
plugin will become testable when all your functions will have an expected output from a defined input.

# Random number

There are two functions: random_number accept a min and a max. Both are integers.  
random_numbers also have min adn max, and also count, so you can get many random numbers.
