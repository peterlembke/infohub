    "icon_note": "Circles placed on a plane fade out one after another. This balls snake go back and forth making it a smooth and beautiful animation. It looks like the popular Fountain AJAX loader, but this one has no small balls that do not move throughout the animation. A nice solution for any application that needs horizontal bar animated image to indicate loading process."
