# Infohub Privacy Browser
You can do a lot of things to increase privacy in your browser. This Infohub plugin will highligt what you share to Infohub and how you can prevent this. The tips can be applied to other sites too.

## Infohub and Cookies
Infohub has the kickout tests. If the browser set a cookie then the user are kicked out of the server.

Cookes are usually used for logging in an keeping track of who was logged in. Infohub uses another approach where session data is part of the message and the browser store session data in the local database.

So there is no need at all for cookies and that is why the kickout tests can kick on all cookies. 

## Infohub and sensors
Infohub will not read your sensors. Automatic data collection is always bad because you will eventually forget that the data are collected. Every upload to the server must be a consious decision.

## The tests
The tests are designed to show you what you reveal to Infohub and how you can prevent that.
