## Browser site settings

Take some time and set your security level for all sites.

* [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/privacy-and-security)

## Browser Plugins

Two plugins I recommend are:

* uBlock origin for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
  or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
* HTTPS Everywhere for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)
