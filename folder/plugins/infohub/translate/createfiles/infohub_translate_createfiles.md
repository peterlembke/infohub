# Infohub Translate Create Files
Here you can select a plugin, a language and then get two files to download.

First file is the original phrases on the left side and a code on the right side.

Second file is the code on the right side and the phrases on the right side. 
You can translate the second file in Google Translate and then use "Merge files" to put the two files together.

The files contain all phrases for the level 1 plugin and all of its children.
