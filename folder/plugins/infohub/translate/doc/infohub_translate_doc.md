## Introduction

Plugins can have translation files in their assets. They are downloaded to the client when the plugin is used. The
plugin can ask InfoHub_Translate for translation data and translate the texts before they are rendered and shown on the
screen. You set your preferred languages in the preferred order in InfoHub_ConfigLocal.
