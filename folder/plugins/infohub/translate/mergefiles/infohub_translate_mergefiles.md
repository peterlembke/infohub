# Infohub Translate Merge files
Here you can merge the key file and the translated file into the final language file for a specific language. 

## GUI
* Button: "Merge the two files"
Will give you a file selector. Here you can select the two files. Use CTRL to select the second file.
When you press ok the files are merged and the resulting file are downloaded.

Rename the resulting file to a proper language code like: sv.json and place the file in
```
folder/plugins/domainname/pluginname/asset/translate/sv.json
```
