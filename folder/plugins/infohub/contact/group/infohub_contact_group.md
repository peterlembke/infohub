Manage groups of server plugins.

## Introduction
In [Infohub Contact](plugin,infohub_contact) you can define client accounts. That is browers and servers that want to login to your server.  
You can define a client name, note, and you get the client username and secter key when you save the new contact.  
You select from a list the level 1 plugin names that the client are allowed to send messages to.  
You also have a list with group names. Click on a group name and the associated plugins are either marked or unmarked from the plugin list.  
Defining these groups is the purpose of this module.

When you "Refresh groups" you will get a list with all groups and also update the plugin list.
You can click on a group in the list to see its details.
Button "New" - Empty the form boxes so you can create a new group.
Button "Save" - Save the new group to the server.
Button "Delete" - Delete the group that has the group name in the form.
