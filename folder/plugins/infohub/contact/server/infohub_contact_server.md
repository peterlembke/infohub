# InfoHub Contact Server

The GUI to handle outgoing connections to other servers

## Introduction

Server means that your server will log in to other servers and use the connection details.  

## Give access to other servers

You can let other servers connect to your server.
Create a normal client account and then export the JSON file. Give the file to the server admin.

## Login to other servers

Your server can log in to other servers.
You have to get an InfoHub contact JSON file from the other server and import it to your system. 

You can modify the node name and the note if you want to.
The node name is important. Your sub calls will use that node name to reach the correct node.

You will also get the domain name to the server in the JSON. If for some reason you know that the domain name has
changed, then you can modify it.  

You can't modify the list of allowed plugins from the GUI. It is also pointles since the server will not grant you any additional rights anyhow.

You can export the data to a JSON.  
You can test the communication with the button "Ping server".
