# Infohub_Login_Export
Here you can export the current contact that you have previously imported.
This is useful for backup or to import on another device so you can login there too.

## Export
The GUI only have one button labeled "Export". Click the button and you will get a file downloaded.
The file name is "contact.json". It is a normal text file formatted in the JSON data format.

You can now rename the file to something meaningful and store it in a safe place.
You can import the file in another device like your phone, tablet, computer etc.

Just remember to never transfer the file in any insecure way.
