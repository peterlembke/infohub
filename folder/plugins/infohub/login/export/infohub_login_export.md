# Infohub_Login_Export

Here you can export the current contact that you have previously imported. This is useful for backup or to import on another device so you can login there too.

## Export

The GUI only have one button labeled "Export". Click the button and you will get a file downloaded. The file name is "contact.json". It is a normal text file formatted in the JSON data format.

You can now rename the file to something meaningful and store it in a safe place. You can import the file in another device like your phone, tablet, computer etc.

## Transfer the file

You need to get the file to the user. Just remember to never transfer the file in any insecure way like email.

For desktop and laptop computers that run Linux/MacOS/Windows you can install Vera encrypt. Create a Vera container and
put the file in there. Now you can transfer the Vera container to the user. You need to share the password to the
container. Transfer the container with an USB-memory or Google Drive or Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive or send the
container through e-mail.

For Apple devices (MacOS/iPad/iPhone) you can use file share over bluetooth.
