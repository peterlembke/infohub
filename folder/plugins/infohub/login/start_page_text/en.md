# What

Infohub is your private place on the web where only you can access your data.

This site is a demo. It has a button where you can download a demo account. Normally a trusted friend install Infohub on
a private server and give you a login file.

# Why

Every phone app / web page / computer program try to get as much data from you as possible. That is your personal
private data, and it should remain private.

# Who

My name is Peter Lembke. I wanted to access my private data from any of my devices and at the same time know that I keep
my data private. That is why I built Infohub

# Where

You or a trusted friend download the Infohub core and install it on a private or public web server or a web hotel. Then
manually issue login accounts to trusted friends and deliver the login files manually to them. The users can login and
use the plugins. The source code is open source, so you can review it before use.

# Missing parts

Two major parts are missing from Infohub:

* Tree plugin - handles the personal data and the encryption keys.
* Plugins that use the Tree plugin.
