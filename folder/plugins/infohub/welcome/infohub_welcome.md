# Infohub Welcome
An inspirational journey into what InfoHub are and will be.
This plugin is the first plugin you will see when you start InfoHub. In this plugin you can read about what you gain with InfoHub. 

# Introduction
InfoHub is an operating system that runs in your browser. You can install programs and run them in your web browser.  

# A web OS you do not have to trust
You can install InfoHub on your own webserver or join a webserver. The open source code is well documented. You can review the code.  

# For your eyes only
Infohub focus on privacy at all levels. The data you produce are for your eyes only.  

# For your special eyes
For your special eyes you have colour schemas and excellent zoom on all devices.  
Celebral palsy and different kinds of shakes make it very hard to use a mouse. The target devices are: touch, keyboard and gamepad. Not mouse.  
Stress is a condition that make you sensitive to information overload. There is no blip and blop in Infohub.  
A full audio feedback is in the planning. Useful for devices without a screen or when you do not use a screen.  

# Your language
Select your preferred languages so Infohub can show you the right text.  
The fallback language for Infohub is world-english. The kind of english that are taught in schools all over the world.  

# My program
You as a user have a big selection of installed plugins to run. You as a webserver manager can download and install more plugins.  
If you have basic programming skills then you can create your own plugins. There are templates that get you going.
