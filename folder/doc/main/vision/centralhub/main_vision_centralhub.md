# Central hub
I would like to use InfoHub to create a hub for InfoHub where you can:   

## Find plugins
Central store for plugins. See how Magento and Wordpress have done. Search for plugins, buy plugins, download plugins, read documentation and ask questions to the developer.  

## Find InfoHubs
Find other infohubs that can provide services to your infohub or to you directly. There should be quality on the list. Criterias and checks.  

## Documentation
Find documentation in the wiki. Read guides how to do things.  

## Download Core
You can find Core files here and download them to set up your own InfoHub. All Core extras and everything you need for InfoHub Core are here.  

## Certified developer
Take a certification and become a certified developer. Find a certified developer  

## Certificate
Central place for public certificates between infohubs  

## Central login
Login service for normal users.
Should not be used for too many users.
You can set up your own central login and let your company or a wider group use that.
