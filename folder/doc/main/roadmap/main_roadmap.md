# Road map for InfoHub
What to focus on in what order

You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/peterlembke/infohub/releases). 

I also have a list with [planned parts I am working on](https://github.com/peterlembke/infohub#planned-parts-i-am-working-on) and [future plans](https://github.com/peterlembke/infohub#future-plans).

This road map is about the [future plans](https://github.com/peterlembke/infohub#future-plans) for the Infohub domain. Planned mile stone versions and when I aim to release them. 
This also means that I can release applications ^^^for^^ the Infohub platform in separate domains and repositories. 

Releases that do not contain any mile stones have a smaller number like version 1.2.6.
Smaller versions can still contain a lot of new things but are not considered a mile stone for Infohub.

Here are the planned mile stones for Infohub.
