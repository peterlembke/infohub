# Requirements
InfoHub only require a web server that run a [supported PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) and the [latest version](https://browsehappy.com/) of a modern web browser.

## Browsers supported
Minimum browsers that InfoHub (JavaScript) aim to support are the [latest version](https://browsehappy.com/) of:  
- Desktop Windows: Edge, Brave, FireFox
- Desktop Ubuntu: Brave, Firefox
- Desktop macOS: Safari, Brave, Firefox
- Apple Phone/Tablet (IOS): Safari
- Android Phone/Tablet: Chrome
- Chrome OS: Chrome
That is many combinations of browser and operating system.

Note that on IOS you have Safari. All other browsers on IOS is based on Safari.

Note that on Android you have Chrome. All other browsers on Android is based on Chrome.

Browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave and Edge are based on Chromium so those browsers are likely to work.

You can read more about [browser engines here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines).
  
  
## Web servers supported
Web servers that InfoHub (PHP) aim to run on. Latest or most used version of:  
- Apache (Developed on latest Ubuntu) because it is commonly used and good.
- Nginx (Tested on latest Ubuntu) because it is the main competitor and fast.

## Varnish
Cache solutions / web accelerators have no effect on web services like Infohub. 
There is no point or even harmful to install Varnish.  

## Hardware that host Infohub
Since you can run a LAMP on Windows, macOS, Linux then you can also host Infohub on these systems.

It works very well to run Infohub on a Raspberry Pi 3. You can read more [here](main,installation_raspberrypi).

## Hardware that consume Infohub
You can use Infohub on any supported browser. My reference platform is an iPhone SE 2016 with a 4" screen. Infohub works well on my old Chromebook, modern Linux, macOS, and Windows. I have tested Infohub OK on older Android.
I have tested with 4" screens (iPhone), iPad, Android 10" pads. In portrait mode and landscape mode. 
HD screen 1920*1080 up to UHD screens (Linux) and it scales good.
