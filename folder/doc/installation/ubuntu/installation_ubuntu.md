# Install on Ubuntu

## Docker
If you want to run docker then you need to do these steps on Ubuntu.

Install Docker like this:
```
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

After the installation, make sure you add your user to the `docker` group, so you can run Docker commands without `sudo` ([read more](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/)).  
Then continue [here](/folder/doc/installation/docker/installation_docker.md).

## Vagrant + VirtualBox
You can run Vagrant + VirtualBox.
Install [VirtualBox](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-virtualbox-on-ubuntu) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).
Then continue [here](/vagrant/README.md)

## Natively
You can install each tool by [yourself](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04) on your Ubuntu machine.
Just remember that InfoHub uses PHP 8. You need to use Ubuntu 21.10 or later to get that.
