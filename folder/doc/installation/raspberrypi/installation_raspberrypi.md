# Installation Raspberry Pi
You can run Infohub on Raspberry Pi. It has been tested with great success with this setup:

* Raspberry Pi 3
* Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* SD card 16Gb
* Apache2
* PHP 7.3
* MariaDb

Infohub do not require a fast server since most things happen in the browser. If the database server (MariaDb) is not warmed up then you can notice failure and just try again.

# Set up Pi
