# The GNU GPL v3 license in general
Nobody should be restricted by the software they use. There are four freedoms that every user should have:  
    
- the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
- the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
- the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
- the freedom to share the changes you make.
    
One important observation here is that you can use GNU GPL software that is publicly available. You can not demand someone to release their changes in a software that is licensed as GNU GPL.  
Please read more here: [Quick guide to GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html)  

# The GNU FDL v1.3 license in general
The GNU Free Documentation License is a form of copyleft intended for use on a manual, textbook or other document to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifications, either commercially or non-commercially. The latest version is 1.3.  
Please read more here: [GNU FDL v1.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html)  

# the Affero GPL license
When you get hold of source code that is licensed with the GNU GPL license, then you have all the freedoms described earlier. "Get hold" of is a wide concept and means that is does not matter HOW the source code was made available, you can use it anyhow without any risk to you.  
If you use a web service that clearly run modified versions of GNU GPL software, then you CAN NOT demand them to make the software available. The Affero GPL license on the other hand require that the changes must be made publicly available.  
Please read more here: [GNU Affero GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html)  
So if you for example run a web server for your web store and your main focus is selling your products, then you should not have to care about making software available. That is why I DO NOT recommend using GNU Affero GPL.  
In later versions of Infohub there might be an optional system available that automatically provide source code and documentation for modified plugins. I recommend that you always use GNU GPL v3 or later, even if this optional (not yet existing) system is activated.  

# Other licenses
Because the way Infohub plugins are constructed, the plugins do not have direct references to other plugins and can therefore be used in projects that are not based on the Infohub system. Each plugin is therefore considered to be a separate program. Each plugin must then have its own license.  
One can claim that child plugins can only operate together with its parent and should then be covered by the parent license. That is not the case because there is only ONE type of plugins. A child plugin can in the right conditions operate without its parent and therefore need its own license.  
This means that if you create your own plugin from scratch, a plugin that is not based on any template, then you are free to use any license you want.  
On the other hand, if you want to run your plugin in the Infohub.se system, then Infohub will check if your plugin is licensed as "GNU GPL v3 or later", if not then your plugin will not start.  

# Make your code available
If you make changes to someones plugin and you think that the changes could be useful to others, then please do a pull request. You do not have to, but the extra effort will make you an "open software contributor", and that can be beneficial for you in the long run.  
If you create your own general plugin and think that it can be useful to others, please make it available with good documentation and licensed as GNU GPL v3 or later. The extra effort will make you an "open software creator", and that can be beneficial for you in the long run.  

# Content licenses
Images, Videos, Sound - All can easily be imported to Infohub, but you must also add detailed information about the license, or else you will not be able to import the material. You can read more here [infohub_file](plugin,infohub_file)
