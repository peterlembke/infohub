# Developer
If you are an experienced developer you probably know everything about dependency injections, inheritance, interfaces, design patterns. Perhaps you also used frameworks like Magento 2 or Laravel where you have to write a lot of code to just make things work in the framework before you can add the logic.

You can probably everything about routes, route resolvers, class mocking, PSR-, soft dependencies, PHPUnit testing, REST, SOAP, XML, JSON, OAuth.

And SQL with left join, distinct, update, tables, views and so on. 

If you are a frontend developer you have probably worked with frameworks like jQuery, Vue.js, bootstrap.js, GraphQL, Ajax calls, JSON and so on.

Being a developer is a never ending battle of learning the new features in the frameworks.

How much fun we could have if we at some point could stop learning and start thinking. We could take our knowledge and do amazing applications.

## Infohub
In Infohub a plugin is ONE class that always only extend the Base class. You send messages to other plugins and get answers. It works the same in PHP and Javascript.
