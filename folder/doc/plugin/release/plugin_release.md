# Release a plugin
You can make your plugin available to a bigger audience  

# Introduction
When you have created a plugin that you think others might find useful then you have some options how to get paid  

- Ask for a contribution with PayPal or similar. (Swish in Sweden)
- Create a server service and charge for usage or a monthly fee. You do not have to disclose the code if it is GPL v3.
- You can sell an optional license. That is a variation of asking for a contribution.
- The customer can purchase development of additions they need. Those are then added to the normal plugin for everyone to use (GPL v3 you know)
