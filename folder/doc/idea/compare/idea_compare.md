# Compare InfoHub
Here I will compare InfoHub with other open source software that seem to be similar.

## InfoHub
* InfoHub is for registering and storing your personal data that only YOU can access on all your devices.
* InfoHub is NOT about sharing data with others. 
* InfoHub is NOT about being anonymous on the internet.
* InfoHub is NOT about making it easier to use other services that handle personal data.

## WordPress / Joomla
Is for writing texts and make them available to read by anyone.
You can lock down your articles and require a login to read them.
Several users can collaborate on articles.

## Grav
Is similar to WordPress. You can write articles in Markdown format and no database is required for storing the texts.

## NextCloud
If you want to collaborate in a company or a group then NextCloud can be for you. You can reach 3rd party services and collaborate on documents in your browser.
NextCloud can be compared to Google Office or Microsoft 365. NextCloud is free to use and comply with GDPR when you run it on your own server.

## Laravel
Is a generic PHP framework that you as a developer can extend to your liking.

## Magento
Mage-OS is the new take on the dormant Magento. It is an e-commerce platform.  

## Conclusion
InfoHub is for you and your data.
WordPress and Grav is for you sharing your articles.
NextCloud is for collaboration in your group.
Laravel is for developers.
Magento is for e-commerce.
