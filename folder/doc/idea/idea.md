# Ideas
I collect ideas for Infohub all the time in Trello.

In this folder you find bad ideas and three domain names that I have.

# Bad ideas
Ideas that first seem like a good idea but after some thinking it turns out to be a bad idea for Infohub.
It could still be a great idea, but not for Infohub.
See [bad ideas](main,idea_bad).

# Infohub
Ideas that would fit into the Infohub Core as system features or around that.
These features / bug fixes will be part of Infohub.  
infohub.se

# TeamFakta
Ideas that evolve around training. I am a big fan of training.  
These ideas might become plugins that are optional and will not be part of Infohub.

# CharZam
