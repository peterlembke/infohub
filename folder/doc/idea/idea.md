# Ideas
I collect ideas for InfoHub all the time in Trello.

In this folder you find bad ideas and three domain names that I have.

# Bad ideas
Ideas that first seem like a good idea but after some thinking it turns out to be a bad idea for InfoHub.
It could still be a great idea, but not for InfoHub.
See [bad ideas](main,idea_bad).

# Good ideas
A good idea is something that fit into the InfoHub concept of a secure personal operating system.
See [good ideas](main,idea_good).

# InfoHub
Ideas that fit into the InfoHub Core as system features or around that.
These features / bug fixes will be part of InfoHub.

# TeamFakta
Ideas that evolve around fitness. I am a big fan of training, food, mental health, sleep.  
These ideas become plugins that are optional and will not be part of InfoHub.
