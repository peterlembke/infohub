# Location

I could ask for the location data. Then I can write a run/bicycle app to Infohub that record the users data. Then the user do not have to upload the data to 3rd party servers.

&& track

Ask to read the GPS in Infohub is a bit contra productive when we try to write a secure privacy system. 
It is better to have a separate application that is specialised on what you want to do.

If you want to record running data then use an app that store the data locally and saves GPX files.
Do calculations on uploaded GPS data is OK. That is data you have uploaded manually.

Enable reading GPS data from the browser into Infohub is a bad idea since it will reveal your position. Infohub do not want to be a part of that.
