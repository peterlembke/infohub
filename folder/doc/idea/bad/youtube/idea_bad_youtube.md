# Youtube
It is easy to embed Youtube videos. Just paste an iframe embed link and you are done.
If we want a more secure way we can activate the iframe sand box.

&& embed

## Comment 1
Youtube have trackers in the iframes. There is no way to prevent the trackers, not even with sandbox. 
Embedding Youtube videos have worked but I have commented the code out due to privacy and license issues.

There will be no Youtube API interface in Infohub.
