# Static web
It would be cool to write articles on Infohub in Markdown and then export them as HTML pages to be uploaded on a public web page.

&& export,share

The use case with static content is limited.
Different clients require different pages. Some need small images. Some want to have a thumbnail to click.
Infohub is about privacy and no sharing of data.

Static pages is not all bad, but you will have to do some things to make it happen.
Infohub will not handle credentials for publishing material.

* Download the material from Infohub to your local device
* Manually upload the data to your web page
* All features associated with a modern WordPress page will not be there, like search

The best alternative would be to just use WordPress as use its built in [Markdown block](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/) with [Jetpack](https://wpengine.co.uk/resources/using-markdown-wordpress/).

All documentation in Infohub is written with Markdown.
