# Email

Infohub could send and receive emails. Building a safe place for reading and writing emails.

Emails are not safe in any way. You need encryption and signing added and there is no standard way built in that everyone uses.
Emails will not be implemented in Infohub.

## Email send
Send email trough transfer.

Infohub can send email to a user that have verified the address.

Getting login information is the only use for sending emails.
You never know who read and change your email.

## Email receive
Anonymous email services are not the purpose of infohub.
Private emails could have been but there is no such thing. Use Signal for private messages.

Use your normal email client for emails.
Receiving emails should be implemented but only for specific usage.
Email is a commonly used and well known way to communicate. With the right way of usage it can be a good tool.
List all use cases.

Email is like shouting out the data publicly.
This will not be implemented.

## Email mass send
Do not harass people. Sending mass email require that you collect data about people. That is against the platform purpose and policy.

There are better suited platforms for sending mass emails.
