# Tilt images
I would like to tilt images and other things because it looks good.

Example [vanilla tilt](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/)
And [photo tilt](https://github.com/tregoning/photoTilt)

The tilt would be affected by mouse and by tilting the phone.

&& render,image,motion

## Comment 1
This looks good. It works on hover, and mouse is not a target device. 
The second library is expected to work with touch screens but does not work at all.
I could find a library that is modern and works on tilting the phone/tablet,
but that goes against the blipp-and-blopp rule to avoid unnecessary motion on the screen.

Moving this to the bad ideas.
