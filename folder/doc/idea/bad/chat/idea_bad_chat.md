# Chat
If Infohub uses Swoole then WebSocket can be used. That means real time traffic between clients and that means a chat client can be created.

There are also open standards for Chat that would be cool to support.

&& communication,share

## Comment 1
Infohub is not about sharing data.
Building a chat client sound awesome, but don't do that within Infohub.

If you also want a secure client then use the app [Signal](https://signal.org/) instead.
Signal exist for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, IOS.
