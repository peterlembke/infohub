# Violent games
I have a great idea for a game that runs in Infohub client and has resources and score cards on the server.
It is kind of violent with guns and shooting.

There are enough violent games. You can use a better suited platform for that.
Violence in games are against the platform policy.

You can write your stand alone games in pygame or in phaser.io or pixi.js
Then you need a library that connect to the infohub server and a token that allow to access only the game data.
Infohub is about private data. Creating a library and a token system and an administrator is a lot of work.

Closing this as a bad idea for infohub.
