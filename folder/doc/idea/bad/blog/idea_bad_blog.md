I want to write texts and put them out on my own blog so that everyone can see them.

Good for you. And you should absolutely do that. I like that too.
InfoHub is not for sharing. There can not be ways where the information in InfoHub can be easily published to the web.

You can write your Markdown texts in InfoHub and copy/paste them to some other application. For example Grav or WordPress.
