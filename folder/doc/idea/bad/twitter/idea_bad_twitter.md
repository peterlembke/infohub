Twitter track you while you use the service. It can also track you on other sites you use. 
The data you provide to the Twitter sites and on their partner sites is the property of Twitter.

There will be a problem to safely store the login credentials on the server to your Twitter account.

Twitter is about sharing. InfoHub is about privacy. Not compatible.

See similar issue with [Facebook](main,idea_bad_facebook).
