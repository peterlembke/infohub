# SMS
Would be cool if InfoHub could send and receive SMS. Then I could improve the log in procedure and send out one time password.
I could also get commands from SMS.

## SMS send
Getting log in information is the only use for sending emails.
A telephone number is private, it is also easy to reroute.
SMS should not be used for log in.

## SMS receive
Receiving SMS to trigger something sounds like a good idea.
SMS is unencrypted. SMS is logged at the phone company.
That makes it no point in using SMS at all.

## SMS mass send
Do not harass people. Sending mass SMS require that you collect data about people. That is against the platform purpose and policy.

There are better suited platforms for sending mass SMS.

## Comment 1
SMS is unencrypted. SMS is stored by the telephone company.
SMS is useless for privacy.
InfoHub is not about sharing information.

SMS is a bad idea.
