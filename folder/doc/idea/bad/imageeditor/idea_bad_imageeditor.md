# Image editor
Would be practical if I could crop, rotate and convert an image to a different file format before upload.
That would save a lot of bandwidth and space on the server.

## Comment 1
There are existing programs better suited for this.

Often you import an image from your phone, and it gets rotated automatically.
Cropping an image is quickly done in other software that is built for image handling.
Same thing with converting an image. It is better done in other software.

Fix the image first, then upload it to InfoHub.

See same problem with [Video editor](main,idea_bad_videoeditor).
