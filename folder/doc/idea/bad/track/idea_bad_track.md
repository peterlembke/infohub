# Tracking

Would be good to know how popular a feature is.

## Track behaviour
We do not have counters, trackers, methods for revealing identity.
We do not read ip numbers, mac addresses, browser brand etc.
We do not log statistics on usage.

But we could log exceptions and warnings to improve the code quality.

This is a privacy system.

## Track position
Tracking position even with user consent is bad. Infohub should not know the position.
Position can be misused. Use other applications than infohub.
