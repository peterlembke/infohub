# Google Search
Would be cool to have a completely anonymous search where you could get results from Google Search and avoid seeing ads and do your own filtering.

&& search,tool

## Comment 1
Google Search, Bing and others track you. The only search that can be used is DuckDuckGo.
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) do not track you. If you want you can visit them with [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to be completely anonymous.

With that in mind there is no point in having search in InfoHub.
