Get category data and product data from magento sites.
Display the products.

This is fast and tracker free.

I do not want to use Google feed. That is a lump of data. But it exists and works. So use it.

I can invent a json format with data for each product.

## Comment 1
This would be a fun thing to approach the e-commerce market. E-commerce is heavily tracked and analyzed. You are not anonymous there. This could be a good tool to be anonymous.

## Comment 2
The e-commerce are heading toward big trading places like Amazon and Alibaba. Smaller tools will be marginalized. It is just like the blogs. A lot of people blogged before. Now they use Facebook instead.

The idea is not bad but is kind of marginalized.
I'll move this to the bad ideas anyhow.
