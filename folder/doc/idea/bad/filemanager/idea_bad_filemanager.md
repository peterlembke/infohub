# File manager
The folder "folder/file" contain plugin-folders and files that each plugin can access.
Would it not be practical to have a manager plugin that can be used by site admins to upload/download/delete/rename files in that folder.

&& file,manage,admin

## Comment 1
Data should be stored with storage to suitable databases.
Files should not be used. Adding a file manager just makes it easier to use files.
It is not a rotten idea but it is not in line with having all data in databases.
Reality is that much data is in files.

This idea is in the bad ideas section for now.
