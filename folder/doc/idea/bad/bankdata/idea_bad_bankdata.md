# Bank data
I would like to get the list with my transactions, so I can see my expenses and get warnings in time.

Data that does not exist can not be stolen. Keep your bank data at your bank. It is safer.
You could download the transaction data and uploaded to InfoHub in an appropriate Tree-app. That could be done.
Accessing a Bank API is a bad idea.
