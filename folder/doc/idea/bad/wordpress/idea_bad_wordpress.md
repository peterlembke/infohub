# Publish on Wordpress
Would it not be cool to write articles in Infohub and then just press a button and they will be published on Wordpress.

Publish article on wordpress is not very useful since there are good tools for that already.
Infohub is not about sharing. Infohub do not want the credentials to you Wordpress to be stored/handled on the server.
