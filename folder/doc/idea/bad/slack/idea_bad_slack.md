# Slack

Would be cool if I could send a message to a Slack channel from InfoHub.

&& communication,share

## Send to Slack
InfoHub could send in data to a Slack channel with the token that is generated.
The token then have to be stored on the InfoHub server.
This is not a totally bad idea since you can always generate a new token if the InfoHub server is compromised.
On the other hand InfoHub is not about sharing.

## Read from Slack
Trigger events in InfoHub from comments in Slack.
InfoHub have (or had) a callback feature, it will be (is) deprecated.

## Comment 1
The problem with connecting to Slack is three things. InfoHub is not about sharing. 
InfoHub do not want to store the token or credentials to reach the Slack channel.
InfoHub had a callback function, but it is now shut down to protect the data that is in InfoHub.
