# Store locator
See and search for stores where you can buy things.
Magento will export the store data to json.
Infohub can use the data.

## Comment 1
I could invent a format and create a store locator. This is one of the steps in using Infohub as a separate e-commerce platform.

## Comment 2
The e-commerce are heading toward big trading places like Amazon and Alibaba. Smaller tools will be marginalized. It is just like the blogs. A lot of people blogged before. Now they use Facebook instead.

The idea is not bad but is kind of marginalized.
I'll move this to the bad ideas anyhow.
