# Smart home
Your smart home can be scheduled and automated.
With Telldus Live you can switch on and off all the lamps manually or on a timer or remotely on your phone.

## Comment 1
There are good software that handle your smart home. If Infohub were to handle that you must give your keys to your login. Infohub do not want them.
Use your normal software for this.

## Comment 2
Earlier you could buy the TellStick. A USB-adapter and download software to run it locally. Now that option does not seem to exist anymore.
A workaround for the tech-savvy is to [do it yourself](https://www.instructables.com/Super-Simple-Raspberry-Pi-433MHz-Home-Automation/).
