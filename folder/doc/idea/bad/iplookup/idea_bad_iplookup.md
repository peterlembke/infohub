# IP lookup
If my friends that use my Infohub server is all from one country then I could use IP lookup to see that the IPs origin from that country before I let them in.

# Comment 1
Ip lookup is as bad as geolocation. It is also no protection since an attacker can use a VPN that end in the right country.
It is also against the platform policy to dig into the visitors private data.
