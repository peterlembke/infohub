# Icon download
Icons are used in infohub. It would be neat if we could download the icons from the common SVG sites and create a license file for each icon.
The manual work involved with using icons would be reduced.

## Comment 1
Icons come from a lot of places. To support all those places or even a couple of them is just waste of work.
The icon often need to be simplified in Inkscape. Colours changed. Things modified. Then saved into an optimal format.
Creating a plugin icon is a lot of work. The download part and creating a license file is a small effort in the whole.

So this is just a bad idea.
