# Video editor
Would be practical if I could cut a video and convert it to a suitable format before upload.
That would save a lot of bandwidth and space on the server.

## Comment 1
There are existing programs better suited for this.

Often you import a video from your phone.
Cuttong a video is quickly done in other software that is built for video handling.
Same thing with converting a video. It is better done in other software.

Fix the video first, then upload it to Infohub.

See same problem with [Image editor](main,idea_bad_imageeditor).
