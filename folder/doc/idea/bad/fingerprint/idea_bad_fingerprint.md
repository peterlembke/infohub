# Fingerprint function
Data can be read from the client to form a fingerprint to identify the computer.
This could be used to improve security while logging in.

## Comment 1
Fingerprint is a way to detect data about the visitor.
Could be used to prevent ill willing persons to enter the site.
Data need to be calculated, stored, calculated again, compared.

InfoHub do not collect, store, use personal data.
This is a strain on the server to keep these persons out. There are better ways with site passwords, log ins.

I'll move this task to bad ideas.
