# Games
You can write your stand alone games in pygame or in phaser.io or pixi.js
Then you need a library that connect to the infohub server and a token that allow to access only the game data.

The Infohub platform would be perfect to store progress, so I can run my game on all my platforms.

# Comment 1
Infohub is about private data. Creating a library and a token system and an administrator is a lot of work.
It is better to use one of the game services that already exist.
Gaming data is a bit private, how often you play and how much.

Closing this as a bad idea for infohub.
