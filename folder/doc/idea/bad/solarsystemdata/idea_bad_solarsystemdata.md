# Solar system data
Would be cool to have solar system data in InfoHub and calculate where the planets are.

## Comment 1
InfoHub is about privacy and private data. Stockpiling public data in InfoHub is not very useful unless you write private notes and want to give a reference to where you have been or saw or talked about.
But even then perhaps an external link to Wikipedia would be better.
