# News from RSS
RSS reader, but no further scraping of data.
The server poll the RSS feeds and store the data on the server.
Then when you connect you will get your mix of feeds filtered on your keywords.

## Comment 1
Rss feeds are usually low quality. Use a rss reader app instead that increase the experience.
I recommend [Newsify](https://newsify.co/) for IOS.
