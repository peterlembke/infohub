# Render form from data
Render a form array from a data array. infohub_renderform.
Then I can render a form very quickly from just data fields.

```json5
{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "age": 50,
    "track": "rabbit", // This is a dropdown but will show as text
}
```

The form will only support text fields and number fields.
I can either show the form as it is for quick editing or use the form array as a template for pouring it into code and do modifications so I can get other form field types.

&& render

## Comment 1
I already have a system to render from a JSON. I will use that instead.
It is the normal rendering system.
