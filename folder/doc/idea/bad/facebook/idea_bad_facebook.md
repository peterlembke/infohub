I care for my privacy, but I also want to communicate with my friends on Facebook.
Can't Infohub have a Facebook client that let the server communicate with Facebook and then the server communicate with my browser.
Then Facebook can not track all data, and I feel safer.

Even if it was just for sending out a post it would still be cool to have in Infohub.

The data you produce on the Facebook sites and their partner sites is the property of Facebook.

If you want to use Facebook then use Facebook as it was intended to be used.
If you are concerned about privacy then do not use Facebook.
Regardless of your Facebook privacy settings, all data are still stored at Facebook and can be used by them at their convenience.

There will be a problem to safely store the login credentials on the server to your Twitter account.

Infohub is a privacy platform, not a social or sharing platform. Facebook has no place here.

The Facebook API can change. Users can be locked out. Fines can be introduced. Facebook do whatever they like.

See similar issue with [Twitter](main,idea_bad_twitter).
