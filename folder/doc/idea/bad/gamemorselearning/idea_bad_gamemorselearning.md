# Learning morse code
I want a game where I can learn morse code in a fun way.
The InfoHub platform would be perfect to store progress, so I can run my game on all my platforms.

&& game

# Comment 1
You can write your standalone games in pygame or in phaser.io or pixi.js
Then you need a library that connect to the InfoHub server and a token that allow to access only the game data.
InfoHub is about private data. Creating a library and a token system and an administrator is a lot of work. 

Closing this as a bad idea for infohub.
