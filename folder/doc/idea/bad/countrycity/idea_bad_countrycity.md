# List with cities and countries
Would be cool to have a list with all cities in the world and have basic information.
When I mention a city in my notes then I can link to the data.

&& data,common_data

InfoHub is about privacy and private data. Stockpiling public data in InfoHub is not very useful.
It would be better to have an external link to Wikipedia.

Public data added to InfoHub will be old. Better to link to Wikipedia.
