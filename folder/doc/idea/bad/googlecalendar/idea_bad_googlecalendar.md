# Google Calendar
Would be cool to have a good calendar where I can book myself and send invites to others to book the same event.
Google Calendar is a very good calendar that has all the important features.
Could we make a client where the InfoHub server read/write to the Google API so that we don't get tracked?

Google Calendar is a very good calendar. Unfortunately the data you provide is owned by Google.
If you want to use Google Calendar then use it as it was intended to be used.
If you do not want to share your calendar data with Google then you need a self-hosted open source calendar software.

InfoHub is not about sharing, it is for private data. A Calendar might come to InfoHub, but you will never be able to send out invites to meetings or find a common free time with your friends calendars.
And by that the calendar idea on InfoHub falls short of important features, but it might be enough features still there to be useful.
