# Investigate How to design an installation guide
I have already investigated the installation procedure [here](../installation/investigate_installation.md)

The conclusion there is that I need to provide a way to configure InfoHub after its files has been uploaded and started.  

## How to start

I am a fan of letting the user tell the system what they want to do.
A plugin that the admin starts.

## What to start
The plugin LocalConfig is only for the local configuration. I need a server config plugin that only Admins can run.

Should it be a guide or a configuration tool. Again I am a fan of letting the admin tell what to do, so no guide.

## What to configure


Work in progress
