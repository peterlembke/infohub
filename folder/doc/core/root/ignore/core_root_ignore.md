# .gitignore and .hgignore
To keep track of all file versions you need a version system. Git is one system, and Mercurial os a similar system.  
Git is very popular and can be used together with web sites like github.com or bitbucket.com. It can also be used stand alone.  
Mercurial is teh same as Git and can be used with web sites like bitbucket.com or stand alone.  
Not all files should go to the repository that git handles. The file .gitignore state what files to ignore.  
Same goes for Mercurial, here the file .hgignore to the same thing.
