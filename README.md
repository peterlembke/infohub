# InfoHub - Your private web operating system

![InfoHub Logo](folder/doc/images/logotype/infohub-logo-done.png)
You reach your encrypted data on all your devices and can run the InfoHub applications you like.
InfoHub is not about sharing. InfoHub run on your own or your friends trusted server, on the Internet or in your private network.

After 15 years the core features are still being developed. InfoHub is stable and secure but lacks three things:
* Automatic translations (LibreTranslate will be used) - Working on that now for version 1.3.40
* Automatic sync of your data between client and server (The Three plugin) - Will be version 1.3.50 
* Applications - Will come a lot of those when the Three plugin is finished.

InfoHub send messages between plugins. That makes all your functions pure, and most core functions are also pure.

Client is written in Javascript. Server is written in PHP. The core files are row by row identical between the languages.
